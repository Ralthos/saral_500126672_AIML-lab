# Experiment 4: Importing and Exporting Data Using Pandas

## Objective

The objective of this experiment is to write a Python program that imports a dataset using Pandas, performs several basic operations such as showing the number of rows, columns, size, and statistics from the numerical columns, and then exports the dataset after these operations.

## Steps Involved

1. **Import a Dataset:**
   - Find a dataset from online sources such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [XAPI](https://xapi.com/datasets), or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
   - Download and use this dataset for the experiment.
   
2. **Python Code:**
   - Write a Python script to:
     - Import the dataset using Pandas.
     - Display basic information about the dataset like the number of rows, columns, first five rows, size of the dataset, number of missing values, and statistical information (sum, average, min, and max values) from the numerical columns.
     - Export the dataset to a new file after the operations.

## Requirements

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. **Pandas Library**: Pandas is used for data manipulation. If not installed, it can be installed using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
