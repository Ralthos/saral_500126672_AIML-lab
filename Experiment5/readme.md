# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Sample Dataset

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sample dataset using Python's Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries. The analysis includes visualizations for age, score, height, weight distributions, and a correlation heatmap to understand the relationships between numerical variables.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is `sample_dataset.csv`. Ensure this file is located in the same directory as the script for it to run successfully.

## Requirements
To run this code, you need the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these packages using pip if you haven't done so already:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
